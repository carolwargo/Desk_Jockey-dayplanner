# FEATURES
When a User opens the daily planner to create a schedule, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Hourly timeblocks for business hours (9am-5pm) will be displayed for the current day. Each timeblock is color coded based on past, present or future hours. When the User clicks on a timeblock, they may enter and save an event in local storage, allowing the saved event to persist.
